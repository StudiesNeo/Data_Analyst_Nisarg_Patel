# üéì UCW Academic Department AWS Cloud Management

  This project builds a serverless, end‚Äëto‚Äëend AWS pipeline for UCWA‚Äôs academic department to analyze workload distribution. I ingest CSV into S3, profile and clean the data via Glue DataBrew, transform and enrich it using Glue ETL and crawlers, then catalogue and query it in Athena. The result is a scalable, maintainable analytics workflow that provides timely insights for academic planning and resourcing.

**AWS Cost Analysis**

**Total Cost of Ownership ‚Äì Delaware North (Paraphrased):**

Delaware North‚Äôs transition to AWS resulted in significant cost savings and enhanced efficiency. The company retired 205 servers, cutting \$3.5 million in expenses over five years. Additionally, it shortened deployment timelines from several weeks to just one day. By moving to AWS, Delaware North boosted agility while substantially lowering infrastructure costs and speeding up operations, making it a smart choice for organizations aiming for high returns on investment.
